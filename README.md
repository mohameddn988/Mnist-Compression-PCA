MNIST Compression and Classification using PCA
This project explores dimensionality reduction techniques using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. It demonstrates how images can be compressed and reconstructed, and how classification performance is affected when trained on compressed data versus original data.

🔍 Key Features:

    PCA-based image compression

    Image reconstruction visualization

    Classification on compressed vs. original data

    Comparison of performance and accuracy

📊 Libraries used: scikit-learn, matplotlib, NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras (optional)

Part of a broader study into compression techniques using deep learning and statistics.
